# Fix Database Error: "prepared statement does not exist"

## 🚨 Current Problem
You're getting errors like:
- `prepared statement "s8" does not exist`
- `prepared statement "s2" already exists`

## ✅ Good News
From the Supabase SQL Editor screenshot, I can see that:
- ✅ The migration was successful
- ✅ All tables exist (Order, OrderItem, Delivery, DeliveryItem)
- ✅ Foreign key constraints are properly set up

## 🔧 Solution Steps

### Step 1: Test Database Connection
1. Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:3000/api/test-db`
2. This will test if the database connection is working
3. Check the response to see what's working

### Step 2: Restart Development Server
The prepared statement error is usually caused by connection issues. Try:

```bash
# Stop the current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

### Step 3: Clear Browser Cache
1. Open browser developer tools (F12)
2. Right-click on refresh button
3. Select "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"

### Step 4: Test Individual APIs
Try accessing these URLs in your browser:
- `http://localhost:3000/api/products`
- `http://localhost:3000/api/orders`
- `http://localhost:3000/api/deliveries`

### Step 5: If Still Having Issues
The prepared statement error is a known issue with Prisma and Supabase. Try this workaround:

1. **Add connection pooling** to your Supabase project:
   - Go to Supabase Dashboard
   - Go to Settings > Database
   - Enable "Connection Pooling"

2. **Or use direct connection**:
   - In your `.env` file, make sure you're using the direct connection URL
   - It should look like: `postgresql://postgres:[password]@db.xxx.supabase.co:5432/postgres`

## 🎯 Expected Results After Fix

Once the error is resolved, you should be able to:
- ✅ Access `/orders` page without errors
- ✅ Access `/delivery` page without errors
- ✅ Create new orders
- ✅ Process deliveries
- ✅ See pending orders in delivery page

## 🔍 Debug Information

The test API (`/api/test-db`) will show you:
- Whether Order table exists
- Whether Delivery table exists
- Whether Product queries work
- Connection status

## 📞 If Still Having Issues

If the problem persists:
1. Check Supabase logs in your project dashboard
2. Verify your DATABASE_URL in `.env` file
3. Make sure you're using the correct connection string
4. Try creating a new Supabase project and migrating the data

## 🚀 Quick Fix Commands

```bash
# Regenerate Prisma client
npx prisma generate

# Restart development server
npm run dev

# Test database connection
curl http://localhost:3000/api/test-db
```
