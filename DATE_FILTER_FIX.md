# Date Filter Fix - Same Day Filtering

## Problem
When filtering by the same date (e.g., from 29 to 29), orders/reports were not showing up. Users had to use from 29 to 30 to see results from the 29th.

## Root Cause
The date filter was using `new Date(to)` which only captures the start of the day (00:00:00), so when filtering from 29 to 29, it was actually filtering from 29 00:00:00 to 29 00:00:00, which excludes any orders created later in the day.

## Solution Applied

### Before (Problematic):
```typescript
if (from || to) {
  where.orderDate = {};
  if (from) where.orderDate.gte = new Date(from);
  if (to) where.orderDate.lte = new Date(to);
}
```

### After (Fixed):
```typescript
if (from || to) {
  where.orderDate = {};
  if (from) {
    const fromDate = new Date(from);
    fromDate.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0); // Start of day
    where.orderDate.gte = fromDate;
  }
  if (to) {
    const toDate = new Date(to);
    toDate.setHours(23, 59, 59, 999); // End of day
    where.orderDate.lte = toDate;
  }
}
```

## How It Works

### Date Range Logic:
- **From Date**: Set to 00:00:00.000 (start of day)
- **To Date**: Set to 23:59:59.999 (end of day)

### Example Scenarios:

#### Scenario 1: Same Day Filter (29 to 29)
- **Before**: `gte: 2024-01-29 00:00:00, lte: 2024-01-29 00:00:00`
- **After**: `gte: 2024-01-29 00:00:00, lte: 2024-01-29 23:59:59`
- **Result**: ✅ Includes all orders from the entire day

#### Scenario 2: Multi-Day Filter (29 to 30)
- **Before**: `gte: 2024-01-29 00:00:00, lte: 2024-01-30 00:00:00`
- **After**: `gte: 2024-01-29 00:00:00, lte: 2024-01-30 23:59:59`
- **Result**: ✅ Includes all orders from both days

#### Scenario 3: Single Day with Time
- **Order created**: 2024-01-29 14:30:00
- **Filter**: from 29 to 29
- **Before**: ❌ Not included (14:30 > 00:00)
- **After**: ✅ Included (14:30 < 23:59:59)

## Files Modified

### 1. Reports Sales API (`src/app/api/reports/sales/route.ts`)
```typescript
// Fixed date filtering for sales reports
if (from) {
  const fromDate = new Date(from);
  fromDate.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
  whereOrder.orderDate.gte = fromDate;
}
if (to) {
  const toDate = new Date(to);
  toDate.setHours(23, 59, 59, 999);
  whereOrder.orderDate.lte = toDate;
}
```

### 2. Orders API (`src/app/api/orders/route.ts`)
```typescript
// Fixed date filtering for orders list
if (from) {
  const fromDate = new Date(from);
  fromDate.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
  where.orderDate.gte = fromDate;
}
if (to) {
  const toDate = new Date(to);
  toDate.setHours(23, 59, 59, 999);
  where.orderDate.lte = toDate;
}
```

### 3. Reports Menu Items API (`src/app/api/reports/menu-items/route.ts`)
```typescript
// Fixed date filtering for menu items report
if (from) {
  const fromDate = new Date(from);
  fromDate.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0);
  whereOrder.orderDate.gte = fromDate;
}
if (to) {
  const toDate = new Date(to);
  toDate.setHours(23, 59, 59, 999);
  whereOrder.orderDate.lte = toDate;
}
```

## Test Scenarios

### Test 1: Same Day Filter
1. Create order on 2024-01-29 at 10:00 AM
2. Create order on 2024-01-29 at 3:00 PM
3. Filter reports/orders: from 2024-01-29 to 2024-01-29
4. ✅ Both orders should appear

### Test 2: Multi-Day Filter
1. Create orders on different days
2. Filter: from 2024-01-29 to 2024-01-30
3. ✅ All orders from both days should appear

### Test 3: Edge Cases
1. Filter: from 2024-01-29 to 2024-01-29 (same day)
2. Filter: from 2024-01-30 to 2024-01-29 (invalid range)
3. ✅ Same day works, invalid range shows no results

## Benefits

1. **Intuitive Filtering**: Same day filters work as expected
2. **Complete Day Coverage**: Includes all orders from the entire day
3. **Consistent Behavior**: All date filters work the same way
4. **User-Friendly**: No need to use "next day" workarounds
5. **Accurate Reports**: Reports show complete data for selected dates

## Technical Details

### Timezone Considerations:
- Uses local timezone for date calculations
- `setHours()` method adjusts time within the same day
- Milliseconds precision (999ms) ensures end-of-day inclusion

### Performance Impact:
- Minimal performance impact
- Date calculations are done once per request
- Database queries remain efficient

## Notes
- This fix applies to all date filtering in the application
- No changes needed on the frontend
- Backward compatible with existing date ranges
- Works with both single-day and multi-day filters
