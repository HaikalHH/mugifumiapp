# Order Edit & Delete Fix

## Problems Fixed

### 1. Edit Order Creates New Order Instead of Updating
**Problem**: When clicking "Edit" and submitting, it created a new order instead of updating the existing one.

**Root Cause**: The submit function always used POST method and `/api/orders` endpoint, regardless of whether it was creating or editing.

### 2. Delete Order Should Only Work for Non-Delivered Orders
**Problem**: Orders could be deleted even if they were already delivered, which could cause data inconsistency.

**Root Cause**: No validation to check if order has deliveries before allowing deletion.

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Edit Order Fix

#### Frontend Changes:
- ✅ Added `editingOrderId` state to track when editing
- ✅ Set `editingOrderId` when opening edit modal
- ✅ Reset `editingOrderId` when creating new order
- ✅ Dynamic API endpoint and method based on edit state
- ✅ Updated modal title to show "Edit Order #X" vs "Create Order"

```typescript
// State management
const [editingOrderId, setEditingOrderId] = useState<number | null>(null);

// Edit handler
const handleEditOrder = async (orderId: number) => {
  setEditingOrderId(orderId); // Set editing state
  // ... populate form with existing data
};

// Submit logic
const url = editingOrderId ? `/api/orders/${editingOrderId}` : "/api/orders";
const method = editingOrderId ? "PUT" : "POST";
```

#### Backend Changes:
- ✅ Created `PUT /api/orders/[id]` endpoint for updating orders
- ✅ Validates order exists and hasn't been delivered
- ✅ Uses transaction to update order and replace order items
- ✅ Recalculates total amount with current product prices

```typescript
export async function PUT(req: NextRequest, { params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  // Check if order exists and hasn't been delivered
  if (existingOrder.deliveries.length > 0) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "Cannot edit order that has been delivered" }, { status: 400 });
  }
  
  // Update order and replace items in transaction
  return prisma.$transaction(async (tx) => {
    // Delete existing order items
    await tx.orderItem.deleteMany({ where: { orderId: orderId } });
    
    // Update order
    await tx.order.update({ where: { id: orderId }, data: { ... } });
    
    // Create new order items
    for (const item of items) {
      await tx.orderItem.create({ data: { ... } });
    }
  });
}
```

### 2. Delete Order Validation

#### Frontend Changes:
- ✅ Added delivery status column to orders table
- ✅ Disabled Edit/Delete buttons for delivered orders
- ✅ Added client-side validation before delete attempt
- ✅ Better error messaging

```typescript
// UI changes
<Button 
  onClick={() => handleEditOrder(order.id)}
  disabled={order.deliveries && order.deliveries.length > 0}
>
  Edit
</Button>

<Button 
  onClick={() => handleDeleteOrder(order.id)}
  disabled={order.deliveries && order.deliveries.length > 0}
>
  Delete
</Button>

// Delivery status column
<Badge color={
  order.deliveries && order.deliveries.length > 0 
    ? (order.deliveries[0].status === "delivered" ? "green" : "yellow")
    : "gray"
}>
  {order.deliveries && order.deliveries.length > 0 
    ? order.deliveries[0].status 
    : "Not Delivered"}
</Badge>
```

#### Backend Changes:
- ✅ Enhanced DELETE endpoint to check for deliveries
- ✅ Prevents deletion of orders with existing deliveries
- ✅ Clear error messages for validation failures

```typescript
export async function DELETE(req: NextRequest, { params }: { params: { id: string } }) {
  // Check if order has deliveries
  if (order.deliveries.length > 0) {
    return NextResponse.json({ error: "Cannot delete order that has been delivered" }, { status: 400 });
  }
  
  // Proceed with deletion
}
```

### 3. API Response Updates
- ✅ Added `deliveries` field to orders API response
- ✅ Includes delivery status information for each order
- ✅ Enables frontend to show delivery status and control button states

```typescript
// API response now includes
deliveries: {
  select: {
    id: true,
    status: true
  }
}
```

## Files Modified

### Frontend:
- `src/app/orders/page.tsx` - Enhanced edit/delete functionality and UI

### Backend:
- `src/app/api/orders/[id]/route.ts` - Added PUT endpoint for updates
- `src/app/api/orders/route.ts` - Added deliveries to response

## User Experience Improvements

### Before Fix:
- ❌ Edit button created new orders instead of updating
- ❌ Delete button worked on delivered orders
- ❌ No visual indication of delivery status
- ❌ Confusing user experience

### After Fix:
- ✅ Edit button properly updates existing orders
- ✅ Delete button only works for non-delivered orders
- ✅ Clear delivery status column in orders table
- ✅ Disabled buttons for delivered orders
- ✅ Better error messages and validation
- ✅ Consistent edit/create workflow

## Validation Rules

### Edit Order:
- ✅ Order must exist
- ✅ Order must not have deliveries
- ✅ All required fields must be provided
- ✅ At least one item required

### Delete Order:
- ✅ Order must exist
- ✅ Order must not have deliveries
- ✅ Admin permission required

## Testing Scenarios

### Edit Order:
1. ✅ Create new order → Edit → Submit → Should update existing order
2. ✅ Edit delivered order → Should show error/disabled button
3. ✅ Edit with invalid data → Should show validation errors

### Delete Order:
1. ✅ Delete non-delivered order → Should work
2. ✅ Delete delivered order → Should show error/disabled button
3. ✅ Delete non-existent order → Should show 404 error

## Benefits

1. **Data Integrity**: Prevents deletion of delivered orders
2. **User Experience**: Clear visual feedback and proper edit functionality
3. **Business Logic**: Enforces proper order lifecycle management
4. **Error Prevention**: Client and server-side validation
5. **Consistency**: Proper CRUD operations for orders
